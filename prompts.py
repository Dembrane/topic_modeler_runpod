- Include specific examples and evidence from the data segments
- Address the broader implications and significance of the findings

**references**: ARRAY
For each data segment that supports your analysis, provide:
- **segment_id**: int - The numerical identifier of the data segment (must be accurate). Each segment_id looks like "SEGMENT_ID_<number>" in the input data - extract only the number portion (e.g., from "SEGMENT_ID_123" use 123)

- **Quality over quantity**: It's better to have fewer, highly relevant references than many irrelevant ones
- **Verify relevance**: Each reference must correspond to content you actually analyzed and cited in your summary

## Quality Standards
- **Depth**: Provide comprehensive analysis that goes beyond surface-level summarization
- **Variety**: Use diverse language and avoid repetitive phrases
- **Evidence**: Support all claims with specific references to data segments
- **Structure**: Maintain clear organization with logical flow
- **Engagement**: Write in an engaging, professional style that maintains reader interest
- **Completeness**: Ensure no critical information is overlooked
- **Relevance**: All content must directly support understanding of the investigated topic
